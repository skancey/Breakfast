    <h1> Buttermilk Pancakes </h1>
      <h2> By: Siddiq Kancey </h2>
        <p> Buttermilk pancakes are my favorite breakfast. Growing up as a kid I had pancakes and eggs everyday.</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
      <ul>
          <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour </li>
          <li> 3 tablespoons white sugar </li>
          <li> 3 teaspoons baking powder </li>
          <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda </li>
          <li> 3/4 teaspoon salt </li>
          <li> 3 cups buttermilk </li>
          <li> 1/2 cup milk </li>
          <li> 3 eggs </li>
          <li> 1/3 cup butter, melted </li>
      </ul>
    <h4> What to do </h4>
      <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a separate bowl, beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs and melted butter. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook. </li>
        <li> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready! </li>
        <li> Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture, using a wooden spoon or fork to blend. Stir until it's just blended together. Do not over stir! Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. </li>
      </ol>
